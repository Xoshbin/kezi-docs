# Tutorial: Paying Your First Vendor Bill

In [Story Two](story-two.md), we recorded a Vendor Bill for our new high-end laptop. Now, it's time to actually pay the vendor and see how Kezi handles the cash movement and accounting entries.

## Objective
By the end of this tutorial, you will have:
1.  Registered a payment for a specific bill.
2.  Confirmed the payment to post it to the ledger.
3.  Verified the updated status of the Vendor Bill.

## Phase 1: Registering the Payment

1.  Navigate to **Accounting > Vendor Bills**.
2.  Find the bill for the "Premium Laptop" (it should be in `Posted` status).
3.  Open the bill.
4.  Notice the **Outstanding Balance** at the bottom.
5.  Click the **Register Payment** button.
6.  In the slide-over:
    - **Journal**: Select `Bank`.
    - **Payment Date**: Select today's date.
    - **Amount**: Keep the full amount (e.g., $2,500).
    - **Reference**: Enter `Payment for Laptop PO-001`.
7.  Click **Create Payment**.

## Phase 2: Confirming the Payment

The payment is now in **Draft** status. It hasn't affected your financial reports yet.

1.  Stay on the Payment record (or go to **Accounting > Payments** to find it).
2.  Review the details.
3.  Click **Confirm**.
4.  The status changes to **Confirmed**.

## Phase 3: Verifying the Results

1.  Go back to the **Vendor Bill**.
2.  Notice the status has changed to **Paid**.
3.  Scroll to the bottom to see the "Amount Paid" and "Amount Due" ($0).
4.  Navigate to **Accounting > Journal Entries**.
5.  Find the entry generated by the payment. You will see:
    - **Debit**: Accounts Payable (the debt is cleared).
    - **Credit**: Outstanding Payments (the money is "on the way" out).

## Summary
You have successfully paid your first bill! Your vendor record is now clear.

## Next Step
To complete the financial cycle, you would normally wait for this transaction to appear on your bank statement and then [Reconcile it](../how-to/bank-reconciliation.md).
