# Setting Up Your Company

Welcome to Kezi ERP! The first step to managing your business is setting up your company profile. This tutorial guides you through configuring your basic company information, localization settings, and branding.

## Prerequisites

- You must have administrator access to the system.
- You have the company logo ready (recommended).

## Step 1: Access Company Settings

1.  Navigate to the **Settings** module in the main menu.
2.  Click on **Company Configuration** or **General Settings**.
3.  You will see the form to edit your current company details.

## Step 2: Basic Information

Fill in the essential details about your organization:

*   **Company Name**: The legal name of your business.
*   **Email**: The primary contact email.
*   **Phone**: The main business phone number.
*   **Website**: Your company's website URL.
*   **Tax ID / VAT Number**: Your tax identification number.

## Step 3: Localization

Configure how the system handles regional formats:

*   **Default Currency**: The main currency for your accounting (e.g., USD, IQD).
*   **Timezone**: Set this to your local timezone (e.g., Asia/Baghdad).
*   **Language**: The default language for system documents.

## Step 4: Branding

Make the system yours by adding your brand identity:

1.  **Logo**: Upload your company logo. This will appear on all generated PDF documents (Invoices, Quotes, etc.).
2.  **Favicon**: Upload a small icon for the browser tab.

## Step 5: Save Changes
