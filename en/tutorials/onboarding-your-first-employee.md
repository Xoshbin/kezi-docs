# Tutorial: Onboarding Your First Employee

Welcome to the company! In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of onboarding a fictional new employee, **Sarah**, as a Sales Representative. By the end of this guide, Sarah will have a complete profile, a contract, and be ready for her first payroll.

### Prerequisites

- You have an "HR Manager" or "Administrator" role.
- Your company's **Departments** (e.g., Sales) and **Positions** (e.g., Representative) are already set up.

### Phase 1: Create Sarah's Record

1. Navigate to **HR → Employees**.
2. Click **New Employee**.
3. Fill in the basics:
   - **Name**: Sarah Jones
   - **Email**: sarah.j@example.com
   - **Department**: Sales
   - **Position**: Sales Representative
4. Click **Save**.

Sarah is now in the system, but she isn't "complete" yet.

### Phase 2: Add Personal & Financial Details

A good HR record helps in emergencies and ensures payments go through.

1. Open Sarah's record and go to the **Personal** tab.
2. Enter her **Phone** number and **Emergency Contact**.
3. Go to the **Financial** tab and enter her **Bank Account**. This is crucial for her future salary payments.
4. Click **Save**.

### Phase 3: The Employment Contract

Sarah needs to be paid! Without a contract, the system won't know her salary.

1. On Sarah's employee profile, look for the **Contracts** section (or navigate to **HR → Contracts**).
2. Create a **New Contract**.
3. Set the **Base Salary** (e.g., $2,500).
4. Set the **Start Date** (her first day).
5. Link it to Sarah and set the status to **Active**.
6. Click **Save**.

### Phase 4: Verification

To make sure everything is set up correctly:

1. Go to **HR → Payrolls**.
2. Start a new payroll for the current month.
3. Select **Sarah** as the employee.
4. If her salary ($2,500) automatically appears, **success!** You have successfully onboarded Sarah.
