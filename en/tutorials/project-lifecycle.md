# Tutorial: Project Lifecycle

In this tutorial, you will learn how to manage a complete project lifecycle in Kezi ERP—from creation and time tracking to budget monitoring and final invoicing. We will follow a real-life scenario of a design agency project.

**Scenario**: You are a project manager at a design agency. You need to create a "Brand Identity Package" project for a client, track hours, and bill them.

---

## Step 1: Create the Project

First, let's set up the project container.

1.  Navigate to **Project Management > Projects**.
2.  Click **Create**.
3.  Fill in the details:
    *   **Project Name**: Brand Identity Package
    *   **Customer**: XYZ Corp
    *   **Billing Type**: Time & Materials (We will bill based on hours worked)
    *   **Budget**: $8,000
    *   **Start Date**: Today's date
4.  Click **Create**.

The project is now in **Draft** status. This means you can plan it out before work begins.

## Step 2: Define Tasks

Break down the work into manageable pieces.

1.  Open your new project.
2.  Go to the **Tasks** tab.
3.  Click **Create** to add tasks:
    *   **Task 1**: Logo Design (Estimated: 20 hours) - Assigned to Sarah
    *   **Task 2**: Brand Guidelines (Estimated: 10 hours) - Assigned to Ahmed
    *   **Task 3**: Color Palette Research (Estimated: 5 hours) - Assigned to Layla
4.  Once planning is done, click **Activate** on the main project page. The status changes to **In Progress**.

## Step 3: Log Time (The Employee View)

Now your team begins work. They will log their hours.

1.  Go to **Project Management > Timesheets**.
2.  Click **Create**.
3.  Select the **Employee** (e.g., Sarah).
4.  Add a line:
    *   **Project**: Brand Identity Package
    *   **Task**: Logo Design
    *   **Hours**: 8
    *   **Billable**: Checked
5.  Click **Submit**.

*Repeat this process for other tasks/employees as needed for the scenario.*

## Step 4: Monitor the Budget

A week has passed. Let's see if we are on track.

1.  Go to **Project Management > Projects** and select your project.
2.  Look at the **Budget** tab or dashboard widget.
3.  You will see:
    *   **Budgeted**: $8,000
    *   **Actual Cost**: Calculated from the approved timesheets (e.g., 35 hours x Hourly Rate).
    *   **Remaining**: The difference.

If you are under budget, the status indicator will be green.

## Step 5: Invoice the Client

The project is complete. It's time to get paid.

1.  Go to **Project Management > Invoicing**.
2.  Click **Create**.
3.  Select **Project**: Brand Identity Package.
4.  The system will automatically pull all **approved, billable** timesheet lines.
5.  Review the line items (Total hours: 50, Rate: $150/hr).
6.  Click **Create Invoice**.

## Step 6: Close the Project

To prevent further time logging on this finished job:

1.  Return to the project page.
2.  Change the status to **Completed**.

**Congratulations!** You have successfully managed a project from start to finish.
