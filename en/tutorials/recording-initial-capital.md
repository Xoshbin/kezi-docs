# Guide: Recording Your Initial Capital Injection

## Overview
This guide explains how to record the initial money you invest into your company to start operations. In accounting terms, this establishes your **Opening Balance** and records your **Owner's Equity**.

**Scenario:** You have deposited **50,000,000 IQD** into your corporate bank account as starting capital.

---

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure the following are set up:

1.  **Company**: Your company details are verified in **Settings > Companies**.
2.  **Chart of Accounts**:
    *   **Equity Account**: Ensure you have an account for `Share Capital` (e.g., `310101`) or `Owner's Equity`.
    *   **Bank Account**: Ensure you have an account for your Bank (e.g., `110102 Bank Account (IQD)`).

## Step 1: Create a Journal Entry
Since this is a capital injection and not a sale or purchase, you will use a manual Journal Entry.

1.  Navigate to **Accounting > Journal Entries** in the sidebar.
2.  Click the **+ Create** button.

---

## Step 2: Fill in the Header Information
Complete the general information for this transaction:

*   **Journal**: Select **"Opening Balance"**. (If unavailable, use "Miscellaneous Operations").
*   **Currency**: Select the currency of the deposit (e.g., **Iraqi Dinar (IQD)**).
*   **Entry Date**: Select the date the money was deposited.
*   **Reference**: Enter a clear description, e.g., `Initial Capital - Hazhin Designs`.

---

## Step 3: Add the Transaction Lines
You need to record two lines to balance the transaction: one for the money coming in, and one for who owns it (you).

### Line 1: The Deposit (Debit)
This records the money entering your bank account.
*   **Account**: Select your Bank Account (e.g., `110102 Bank Account (IQD)`).
*   **Debit**: Enter the amount (e.g., `50,000,000`).
*   **Credit**: Leave as `0`.
*   **Description**: "Initial Bank Deposit".

### Line 2: The Equity (Credit)
This records your claim on the company's assets.
*   **Account**: Select your Equity Account (e.g., `310101 Share Capital`).
*   **Debit**: Leave as `0`.
*   **Credit**: Enter the same amount (e.g., `50,000,000`).
*   **Description**: "Owner Share Allocation".

**Verification:** Check the totals at the bottom. **Total Debit** must equal **Total Credit**.

Click **Create** to save and post the entry.

## Step 4: Verify the Result
To ensure the transaction was recorded correctly:

1.  Go to your **Dashboard**. The corresponding Bank card should now reflect the deposited balance.
2.  Navigate to **Accounting > Reporting > Balance Sheet**.
    *   Verify that **Assets** shows your bank balance.
    *   Verify that **Equity** shows your Share Capital.

Your company is now funded!
