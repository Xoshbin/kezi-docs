# Understanding Cash Advances

This guide explains **Employee Cash Advances**—what they are, why we use them, and how to manage the lifecycle from "Can I have some money?" to "Here are my receipts." Written for everyone, this guide breaks down the process of requesting, spending, and settling company funds.

## What is a Cash Advance?

Imagine you are going on a school trip. You ask your parents for **$50** to buy lunch and souvenirs.
1.  They give you the money (**Advance**).
2.  You go on the trip and buy a sandwich for $10 and a keychain for $5 (**Expense**).
3.  When you get home, you give them the receipts and the remaining **$35** change (**Settlement**).

In business terms:
An employee needs money for a business purpose (travel, buying supplies) *before* they spend it. The company gives them the cash/transfer, and later the employee proves how they spent it.

**The Workflow at a Glance:**
1.  **Request**: "I need money."
2.  **Approval**: "Okay, here is the money."
3.  **Expense Report**: "Here is what I spent."
4.  **Settlement**: "Here is the change" OR "I spent extra, please pay me back."

## The Workflow: Step-by-Step

Let's walk through a real-life example.

**Scenario**: You are an employee, "Alice," traveling to a conference. You need **$500** for taxi and meals.

### Step 1: The Request (Draft) 📝
You create a **Cash Advance Request** in the system.
*   **Amount**: $500
*   **Purpose**: "Travel Expenses for Tech Conference"
*   **Status**: Draft

### Step 2: Approval & Disbursement 💰
Your manager reviews the request.
1.  **Approval**: The manager clicks "Approve."
2.  **Disbursement**: The finance team sends the money to your bank account or gives you cash.
    *   *System Action*: The system creates a debt record. Alice now "owes" the company $500 until she proves she spent it on business.
    *   **Status**: Disbursed

### Step 3: Spending the Money 🛒
You go to the conference.
*   You pay **$50** for a taxi.
*   You pay **$100** for a team dinner.
*   **Total Spent**: $150.
*   **Remaining in your pocket**: $350.

### Step 4: The Expense Report 🧾
You come back to the office. You cannot just keep the $350! You must account for it.
You create an **Expense Report** linked to your Cash Advance.
*   **Line 1**: Taxi ($50)
*   **Line 2**: Dinner ($100)
*   **Total Expenses**: $150

### Step 5: Settlement (The Balancing Act) ⚖️
Now we compare what you took vs. what you spent.

**The Math:**
1.  **You Took**: $500
2.  **You Spent**: $150
3.  **Difference**: $350 (You still have this!)

**Three Endings:**

#### Scenario A: You spent LESS (Return Cash)
*   You owe the company **$350**.
*   You pay the cash back to the finance team.
*   **Result**: Debt cleared. Advance Status: **Settled**.

#### Scenario B: You spent MORE (Reimbursement)
*   Imagine you spent **$600** (more than the $500 advance).
*   The company owes *you* **$100**.
*   The finance team pays you the extra $100.
*   **Result**: Debt cleared. Advance Status: **Settled**.

#### Scenario C: Exact Match
*   You took $500 and spent exactly $500.
*   No money moves hands.
*   **Result**: Debt cleared. Advance Status: **Settled**.

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Your Receipts! 📎
You cannot clear your debt without proof. Always take a photo of your taxi, meal, or supply receipts.

### 2. One Advance at a Time
Try to settle your current advance before asking for a new one. It keeps the accounting clean.

### 3. Return Unused Money Quickly
If you didn't spend it, it's not a bonus! Return the change to the finance team immediately upon return so the advance can be settled.

## Troubleshooting Common Questions

**Q: Why does the system say I "owe" the company money?**
A: Legally, a cash advance is a temporary loan. Until you submit your Expense Report proving it was for business, that money is considered personal debt.

**Q: Can I request an advance in a different currency?**
A: Yes! If you are traveling to Europe, you can request an advance in Euros (EUR) even if your salary is in Dollars (USD).

**Q: What if I lose a receipt?**
A: Talk to your finance manager. Usually, you will have to pay that amount back from your own pocket because the company cannot verify the expense.
