# Financial Reporting Concepts

Understanding how Kezi calculates and structures financial reports is essential for maintaining accurate books and making informed business decisions.

## The Trial Balance vs. The Balance Sheet

While both reports provide a summary of your accounts, they serve different purposes and use different structures.

### The Trial Balance
The **Trial Balance** is an internal reporting tool. It is a raw list of ALL accounts in the Chart of Accounts that have a balance.
- **Goal**: To verify that Total Debits = Total Credits.
- **Structure**: A flat list of accounts with their current Debit or Credit balance.
- **Check**: Used by accountants as a "sandbox" to spot entries made to the wrong accounts before finalizing statements.

### The Balance Sheet
The **Balance Sheet** is an external-facing financial statement.
- **Goal**: To show the company's financial position (Assets, Liabilities, Equity).
- **Structure**: Grouped by the Accounting Equation: `Assets = Liabilities + Equity`.
- **Calculations**: It aggregates accounts into higher-level categories (e.g., combining multiple bank accounts into "Cash and Cash Equivalents").

## How Net Profit Flows to the Balance Sheet

One of the most important concepts in Kezi is the link between the **Profit and Loss (P&L)** and the **Balance Sheet**.

1.  The **Profit and Loss** report calculates your **Net Profit** (Revenue - Expenses) for a specific period.
2.  In the **Balance Sheet**, this Net Profit is displayed under the Equity section as **Current Year Earnings**.
3.  When a fiscal year is closed, these earnings are typically moved to **Retained Earnings**.

> [!NOTE]
> If your Balance Sheet feels "off," the first place to check is the Profit and Loss statement for the same date range. A discrepancy in P&L will always reflect in the Balance Sheet's Equity section.

## The Accounting Equation in Kezi

Kezi strictly enforces the double-entry system. Every transaction must be balanced.
- **Assets**: What the business owns (Cash, Inventory, Equipment).
- **Liabilities**: What the business owes (Vendor Bills, Loans).
- **Equity**: The owner's residual interest in the assets after deducting liabilities.

The system ensures that `Total Assets` always equals `Total Liabilities + Total Equity`.

## Cash vs. Accrual Reporting

Kezi primarily operates on an **Accrual Basis**. This means:
- **Revenue** is recognized when an Invoice is validated, not necessarily when the cash is received.
- **Expenses** are recognized when a Vendor Bill is recorded, not necessarily when the bill is paid.

This provides a more accurate picture of your long-term financial health compared to simple cash-in/cash-out tracking.
