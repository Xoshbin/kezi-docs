# Understanding Request for Quotations (RFQ)

A Request for Quotation (RFQ) is a document you send to vendors asking them to provide pricing for specific products or services. It's a key part of the procurement process.

## Overview

RFQs help you compare vendor pricing before committing to a purchase. You can send the same RFQ to multiple vendors and evaluate their responses to choose the best offer.

## RFQ Workflow

```
Draft → Sent → Received → Converted to PO
  └── Cancelled
```

1.  **Draft**: Create and edit the RFQ
2.  **Sent**: RFQ sent to vendor(s)
3.  **Received**: Vendor responds with pricing
4.  **Converted to PO**: Accept and create Purchase Order

## Key Information

### RFQ Header

*   **Vendor**: Who you're requesting a quote from
*   **Request Date**: When the RFQ was created
*   **Response Deadline**: When you need the quote by
*   **Reference**: Your internal tracking number
*   **Currency**: Which currency for pricing

### RFQ Lines

Each line specifies what you need:
*   **Product**: What you want to purchase
*   **Quantity**: How much you need
*   **Unit of Measure**: Units (each, kg, hour, etc.)
*   **Expected Price**: Optional budget guidance
*   **Delivery Date**: When you need it

### Vendor Response

*   **Unit Price**: Vendor's quoted price
*   **Lead Time**: How long until delivery

2.  Click **Create RFQ**.
3.  Select the vendor.
4.  Add products and quantities.
5.  Set response deadline.
6.  Click **Send RFQ** to email to vendor.

## Comparing Quotations

When you receive responses:

1.  Open each received RFQ.
2.  Review prices and terms.
3.  Compare side-by-side if available.
4.  Select the best offer.
5.  Convert winning RFQ to Purchase Order.

## Converting to Purchase Order

Once you accept a quotation:

1.  Open the RFQ.
2.  Verify all details.

## Best Practices

1.  **Request Multiple Quotes**: Compare at least 2-3 vendors

4.  **Document Decisions**: Record why you chose a vendor
5.  **Track Response Rates**: Note which vendors respond reliably
