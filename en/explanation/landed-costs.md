# Understanding Landed Costs

Landed costs represent the **real cost** of acquiring inventory. When you buy goods, the price you pay the supplier is often just one part of the total expense.

## What are Landed Costs?

Think of landed costs as the "total bill" for getting a product to your warehouse shelf. It includes:

- 🚢 **Freight & Shipping**: Transporting goods from the supplier.
- 🏛️ **Customs & Duties**: Government taxes on imported items.
- 🛡️ **Insurance**: Coverage for goods while in transit.
- 📦 **Handling**: Port fees, loading/unloading, and warehouse processing.

**Why does this matter?**
Without landed costs, you might think a product costs $10 when it actually costs $12. This leads to:
1. **Understated Costs**: Your financial reports show lower expenses than reality.
2. **Overstated Profits**: You think you're making more money than you are.
3. **Bad Pricing**: You might set your selling price too low to cover your true costs.

## Accounting Impact

Accounting standards (like IFRS and GAAP) require you to **capitalize** these costs. Instead of recording shipping as an immediate expense, it is added to the value of the inventory asset.

### Without Landed Costs (Incorrect)
- **Inventory Value**: $1,000 (Purchase price only)
- **Shipping Expense**: $200 (Recorded immediately as a loss)
- **Total Asset**: $1,000

### With Landed Costs (Correct)
- **Inventory Value**: $1,200 (Purchase price + Shipping)
- **Shipping Expense**: $0 (The cost is stored in the asset until the item is sold)
- **Total Asset**: $1,200

When you finally sell the product, the full $12 cost moves to **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**, giving you an accurate profit calculation.

## Impact on Profitability

Consider a smartphone sold for $350:

| Metric | Without Landed Costs | With Landed Costs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sale Price** | $350.00 | $350.00 |
| **COGS (Cost)** | $200.00 | $220.88 |
| **Gross Profit** | **$150.00** | **$129.12** |
| **Margin** | 42.9% | 36.9% |

The 6% difference in margin is critical for business decision-making.
