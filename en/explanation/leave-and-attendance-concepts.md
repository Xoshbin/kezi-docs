# Understanding Leave and Attendance

Effective time-off and presence tracking are critical for maintaining team productivity and ensuring accurate payroll. In Kezi, the Leave and Attendance modules work together to provide a complete picture of staff availability.

### Leave Management Philosophy

Leave management is designed to be fair and transparent. It ensures:
1. **Entitlement Tracking**: Employees know exactly how many days they are entitled to based on their contract.
2. **Planned Absence**: By requiring approvals, managers can ensure there is enough coverage before someone goes on vacation.
3. **Legal Compliance**: Proper tracking of sick leave and maternity/paternity leave ensures the company meets labor law requirements.

#### Accrual Methods
Leave "balances" can be allocated in different ways:
- **Annual**: The full year's balance is given on January 1st.
- **Monthly**: A portion of the balance is added at the end of each month worked.

### Attendance Tracking

Attendance records the actual presence of an employee. While leave tracks planned time off, attendance tracks the day-to-day "clock-in" and "clock-out" events.

#### Why Track Attendance?
- **Payroll Impact**: If an employee is marked as absent without an approved leave request, this can trigger a "Unpaid Leave" deduction in the payroll module.
- **Operational Safety**: Knowing who is currently on-site is crucial for safety and coordination.
- **Performance**: Consistent attendance records help in annual performance reviews.

### Integration with Other Modules

- **HR / Employee Record**: Leave balances are typically viewed on the employee profile.
- **Payroll**: The system pulls "Unpaid Leave" days and attendance data to calculate the final net salary.
- **Calendar**: Approved leave is automatically added to the company or team calendar.
