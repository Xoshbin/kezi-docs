# Project Invoicing: Getting Paid for Your Work

This guide explains how to turn your project work into invoices. Whether you bill by the hour, by milestone, or a fixed price, we've got you covered.

## What is Project Invoicing?

Think of Project Invoicing as the bridge between the work your team does and the money your company earns. When you spend time on a project or complete a milestone, you need to tell your customer, "Hey, this is done, please pay us."

**Why does this matter?**
1.  **Revenue**: It's how you get paid for your services.
2.  **Accuracy**: Ensures customers are billed exactly for the time/work agreed upon.
3.  **Tracking**: Connects your project progress directly to your financial books.

## Billing Models

There are two main ways to bill for projects:

### 1. ⏱️ Time & Material (Billable Hours)
You charge the customer based on how much time you spend.
*   **Best for**: Consulting, support, or flexible projects.
*   **How it works**: Your team logs time on tasks ("I spent 4 hours coding"). You create an invoice that pulls in all those unbilled hours.

### 2. 🎯 Fixed Price / Milestones
You agree on a set price for the whole project or specific parts of it.
*   **Best for**: distinct deliverables or fixed-budget projects.
*   **How it works**: You bill when a milestone is reached (e.g., "Design Phase Complete - $5,000"). Time spent doesn't change the price.

## The Workflow

Here is how the process usually flows:

```
    Work Done         Review            Invoice            Cash
   (Tasks/Time)  ──▶  (Approve)   ──▶  (Create)   ──▶   (Collect)
       🔨                👀               📄               💰
```

1.  **Work Done**: Team members log time sheets or complete milestones.
2.  **Review**: Managers check if the work is ready to be billed.
3.  **Invoice**: You generate a Project Invoice.
4.  **Cash**: The customer pays the invoice.

## How to Create a Project Invoice

### Step 1: Go to Project Invoices
Navigate to: **Project Management → Project Invoices → Create Invoice**

### Step 2: Choose Your Scope
You'll need to decide what you are billing for.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Project** | Select the project you are billing. |
| **Type** | **Timesheets** (for hours) or **Fixed Amount/Milestone**. |
| **Date Range** | If billing time, which dates? (e.g., "Last Month"). |
| **Customer** | Automatically filled from the project usually. |

### Step 3: Generate
Click **Create**. The system will look for all "Billable" but "Unbilled" items that match your criteria and create a draft invoice.

> [!TIP]
> **Billable vs. Non-Billable**: Not all work needs to be paid for. On tasks, you can mark items as non-billable if they are internal work or courtesy fixes.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Why is my invoice empty (0 amount)?
A: This usually happens because:
*   **No Billable Time**: Your team logged time, but maybe the tasks are not marked as "Billable".
*   **Already Invoiced**: Maybe these hours were already included on a previous invoice.
*   **Wrong Date Range**: Did you select the period where the work actually happened?

### Q: How do I invoice a Milestone?
A: When creating the invoice, select **Fixed Amount** or **Milestone** as the type. You can then specify manually the amount or select the defined milestone from the project plan.

## Best Practices
*   **Approve Time Weekly**: Don't let timesheets pile up. Review them weekly so billing is smooth at month-end.
*   **Clear Descriptions**: When logging time, write details your customer will understand (e.g., "Fixed login bug" instead of "coding").
*   **Check Rates**: Make sure your "Price per Hour" is set correctly in the Project settings before invoicing.
