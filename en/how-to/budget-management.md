# Budget Management: Planning for Success

This guide explains how Budget Management works in Kezi. Whether you're a financial planner or a business owner, this tool helps you set targets and track your performance against them.

## What is Budget Management?

Think of a Budget as your financial roadmap. It allows you to set targets for income (like sales goals) or limits for expenses (like a marketing budget) over a specific period.

**Why does this matter?**
1. **Control**: Keep spending in check.
2. **Goals**: Set clear targets for your sales team.
3. **Insight**: Compare what you *planned* to happen with what *actually* happened.

## Where to Find It

Navigate to: **Accounting → Budgets**.

You'll see a list of all your budgets, showing their status and period.

> **💡 Tip**: Look for the Help button in the top-right corner—it opens this guide!

## Creating a Budget

Let's walk through creating a new budget step by step.

### Step 1: Start Fresh

Navigate to **Accounting → Budgets** and click **Create Budget**.

You'll see a form with these fields:

| Field | What to Enter | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Name** | A descriptive name for your budget | "Sales Budget 2026" or "IT Expenses Q1" |
| **Responsible** | The person in charge of this budget | "John Doe" |
| **Period** | The Start and End dates | Jan 1, 2026 - Dec 31, 2026 |
| **Company** | The company this budget belongs to | My Company |

### Step 2: Add Budget Lines

This is where you define the details. Each line targets a specific account.

1. Click **Add Line**.
2. **Budgetary Position**: Select the General Accounts (e.g., "Product Sales") you want to track.
3. **Analytic Account**: (Optional) Link to an analytic account (e.g., "Project A" or "Department X") for more granular tracking.
4. **Planned Amount**: Enter your target amount.
5. **Practical Amount**: This is calculated automatically based on your actual accounting entries.
6. **Achievement**: Shows your progress as a percentage.

### Step 3: Confirm the Budget

Once you're happy with your plan, click **Confirm**. This makes the budget official and allows you to start tracking performance.

## Monitoring Performance

The real power of budgeting comes from tracking your progress.

### Planned vs. Practical

- **Planned Amount**: What you *hoped* to achieve.
- **Practical Amount**: What *actually* happened (based on posted journal entries).
- **Theoretical Amount**: Where you should be *right now* based on how much time has passed.

### Example Scenario: Marketing Budget

**The situation**: You set a budget of $12,000 for "Marketing Expenses" for the year (Jan - Dec).

1. **Plan**: You create a budget line for the "Marketing" account with a **Planned Amount** of $12,000.
2. **Action**: In January, you receive a vendor bill for $1,000 for ad placement and post it.
3. **Result**:
    - **Planned**: $12,000 (Total for year)
    - **Practical**: $1,000 (Spent so far)
    - **Achievement**: 8.3%

If it's only January, you're on track! If it's December and you've only spent $1,000, you might have extra budget left over.

## Best Practices

### 📅 Period Setup
- **Match Fiscal Years**: Align your budgets with your company's fiscal year for easier reporting.
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Don't wait until year-end. Review your achievement percentage every quarter.

### 🎯 Accuracy
- **Use Analytic Accounts**: Budgets are most powerful when combined with Analytic Accounts (e.g., budgeting per specific project).
- **Realistic Targets**: Set achievable goals based on historical data.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Why is my "Practical Amount" zero?
A: Check the following:
1. **Posted Entries**: Only *posted* journal entries count towards the practical amount.
2. **Correct Account**: Did you book the expense to the exact account defined in your Budgetary Position?
3. **Date Range**: Is the entry date within the budget's Start and End dates?

### Q: Can I edit a budget after confirming?
A: Generally, running budgets should be locked to preserve the plan. However, depending on your permissions, you may be able to reset it to draft to make changes.
