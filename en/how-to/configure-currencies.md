# Configuring Currencies

If your business operates in multiple currencies, Kezi ERP allows you to manage exchange rates and transact in any currency.

## Enabling Multi-Currency

1.  Go to **Settings > Accounting > Currencies**.
2.  Enable the **Multi-Currency** feature if not already active.
3.  Select your **Main Currency** (Reporting Currency).

## Adding a New Currency

1.  Navigate to the **Currencies** list.
2.  Click **New Currency** or enable an existing one from the list of inactive currencies.
3.  Set the **Symbol**, **Decimal Places**, and **Active** status.

## Managing Exchange Rates

Exchange rates determine the value of transactions in your main currency.

1.  Open the currency you want to update (e.g., EUR).
2.  Go to the **Exchange Rates** tab or history.
3.  Click **Add Rate**.
4.  Enter the **Date** and the **Rate** (e.g., 1 USD = 0.92 EUR).
5.  Save.

The system will use the rate effective on the transaction date.
