# Managing Users

Managing users effectively is crucial for system security and operational efficiency. This guide explains how to invite new users, assign roles, and manage their access.

## Creating a New User

1.  Navigate to **Settings > Users & Roles > Users**.
2.  Click the **New User** button.
3.  Enter the user's details:
    *   **Name**: Full name of the user.
    *   **Email**: Their login email address.
    *   **Password**: Set an initial password (users can change this later).
4.  Select the appropriate **Role** (e.g., Administrator, Manager, User).
5.  Click **Create User**.

## Assigning Roles and Permissions

Roles define what a user can see and do in the system.

1.  Go to **Settings > Users & Roles > Roles**.
2.  You can use default roles or create a custom one.
3.  To assign a role to a user:
    *   Open the user's profile from the **Users** list.
    *   In the **Roles** section, select the desired role(s).
    *   Save changes.

## Deactivating a User

If an employee leaves or no longer needs access:

1.  Navigate to the **Users** list.
2.  Find the user and click on their record.
3.  Set their status to **Inactive** or click **Deactivate**.
4.  This prevents them from logging in but preserves their historical data.

## Resetting Passwords

If a user forgets their password:

1.  Open the user's profile.
2.  Click the **Reset Password** action.
3.  Enter a new password or send a password reset link to their email.
