# Tracking Stock Movements

Every physical change in your inventory is recorded as a **Stock Movement**. This guide shows you how to trace these movements, audit your history, and understand where your stock is going.

For a high-level overview of inventory flow, see [Explanation: Inventory Concepts](../explanation/inventory-concepts.md).

## Viewing the Audit Trail

To see a complete history of every item that arrived, shipped, or moved:

1. Navigate to **Inventory → Stock Movements**.
2. **Key Information**:
   - **Date**: When the move was completed.
   - **Reference**: The document that caused the move (e.g., a Vendor Bill or Internal Transfer).
   - **From/To**: The exact source and destination locations.
   - **Quantity**: How many units were moved.

## Tracing a Specific Product

If you suspect an error in your stock count:

1. Go to **Inventory → Products → Products**.
2. Open the product you want to investigate.
3. Click the **Moves** button (or History tab).
4. This shows *only* the movements for this specific product, making it easy to spot duplicates or missing receipts.

---

## Managing Manual Movements

While most movements are automatic (from Bills or Invoices), you can create manual moves for internal warehouse organization:

1. Click **Create Stock Movement**.
2. Select the **Product**, **Source**, and **Destination**.
3. Enter the **Quantity**.
4. Click **Confirm** and then **Process** (or Mark as Done).

---

## Lot & Serial Number Traceability

If a product has Lot tracking enabled:

1. Go to **Inventory → Lot/Serial Numbers**.
2. Open a specific lot.
3. Click the **Traceability** button.
4. You will see everywhere that specific batch went—from the vendor receipt to the final customer delivery.
