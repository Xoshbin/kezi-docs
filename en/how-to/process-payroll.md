# How-to: Process Payroll

This guide walks you through the monthly process of calculating and paying employee salaries.

### Prerequisite Checklist
Before starting a payroll run, ensure:
1. The employee has an **Active** status.
2. There is an **Active Contract** for the employee.
3. All **Leave Requests** for the period have been approved or rejected.

### Step 1: Create the Payroll Record

1. Navigate to **HR → Payrolls**.
2. Click **New Payroll**.
3. Select the **Employee**.
4. Set the **Start Date** and **End Date** (usually the full calendar month).
5. The system will automatically fetch the base salary and allowances from the contract.

### Step 2: Review and Adjust

Review the pre-calculated numbers. If adjustments are needed:
- **Overtime/Bonuses**: Add these to the "Other Earnings" or "Allowances" section.
- **Unpaid Leave**: Check the total days. The system will suggest a deduction amount based on the daily rate.
- Click **Save** to keep the record in Draft mode for further review.

### Step 3: Approve and Post

Once you are confident the numbers are correct:
1. Click the **Approve** button.
2. The status will change to **Processed**.
3. **Check the Journal Entry**: In the "System Info" tab, you will find a link to the automatically created accounting entry.

### Step 4: Pay the Employee

After approval, the salary is a liability. To record the actual payment:
1. Open the processed payroll.
2. Click **Pay Employee**.
3. Select the **Bank/Cash Account** the money is coming from.
4. Enter the **Payment Date**.
5. Save the payment dialog. The payroll status will change to **Paid**.
