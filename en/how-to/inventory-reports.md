# Inventory Reports & Analysis

Data is power. Kezi ERP provides a suite of advanced reports to help you understand your stock value, identify slow-moving items, and ensure you never run out of critical inventory. This guide explains how to read and use each report.

---

## 1. Inventory Valuation Report
**Goal**: Know exactly how much money is tied up in your warehouse.

- **What it shows**: The quantity of each product on hand, its unit cost (based on FIFO, AVCO, or Standard), and the total value.
- **Key Use Case**: Financial audits, monthly closing, and assessing total asset value.
- **Filters**: You can filter by Location, Category, or Product to see value in specific areas.

---

## 2. Inventory Aging Report
**Goal**: Identify "dead stock" or items that have been sitting in the warehouse for too long.

- **What it shows**: Categorizes stock into "age buckets" (e.g., 0-30 days, 31-90 days, 180+ days).
- **Key Use Case**: Identifying items that need discounts or liquidation to free up space and cash.
- **Why it matters**: Aged stock loses value over time (obsolescence) and costs money to store.

---

## 3. Inventory Turnover Report
**Goal**: Measure how efficiently you are moving stock.

- **What it shows**: The ratio of how many times you have sold and replaced your inventory during a specific period.
- **Key Use Case**: Comparing different products to see which ones are high-demand and which ones are inefficient.
- **Low Turnover**: Means you are overstocking or sales are low.
- **High Turnover**: Means strong sales, but watch out for stockouts!

---

## 4. Lot Traceability Report
**Goal**: Track the history of a specific batch of products.

- **What it shows**: Every movement associated with a specific Lot or Serial Number—from initial receipt from the vendor to final delivery to the customer.
- **Key Use Case**: Quality recalls (e.g., "We found a defect in Lot #402, who did we sell it to?") and expiration tracking.
- **Drill-down**: You can click on any movement to see the related Vendor Bill or Delivery Note.

---

## 5. Reorder Status Report
**Goal**: Prevent stockouts and automate procurement.

- **What it shows**: Which products are below their "Minimum Stock Rule" and how many need to be ordered to reach the "Maximum" level.
- **Key Use Case**: Daily operations for the Purchasing team to generate Requests for Quotation (RFQs) based on actual needs.
- **Status Indicators**: Highlights products in "Danger" (below minimum) in red.

## How to use the Reports

### Exporting Data
Every report page in Kezi ERP includes an **Export** button. You can download the data in Excel or PDF format for:
- Sharing with management
- Further analysis in spreadsheets
- Printing for warehouse staff

### Filtering & Grouping
Don't get overwhelmed by data. Use the filter bar to:
- See reports for a **specific warehouse**.
- Group by **Product Category** (e.g., "Electronics" vs "Furniture").
- Analyze specific **Date Ranges**.

## Best Practices for Inventory Analysis

### 1. The 80/20 Rule (ABC Analysis)
Usually, 20% of your products generate 80% of your value or turnover. Use the **Turnover Report** to identify these "Class A" items and ensure they are managed with extra care.

### 2. Monitor Aging Monthly
Set a routine to check the **Aging Report** every month. If items hit the 180-day mark, create a sales promotion to clear them out before they become a total loss.

### 3. Trust the Reorder Report
Don't order based on "gut feeling." Use the **Reorder Status Report** to make data-driven purchasing decisions that keep your lean and efficient.
