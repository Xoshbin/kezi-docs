## Creating a Project Budget

### Step 1: Access Budget Creation

1. Go to **Project Management → Budgets**.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Select the **Project** you're budgeting for.
4. Enter the **Budget Name** (e.g., "Initial Budget Q1").

### Step 2: Define Budget Lines

Add a line for each cost category you expect to incur.

| Category | Description | Budgeted Amount |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Labor** | Estimated hours * rate. | $15,000 |
| **Materials** | Licenses, servers, physical goods. | $2,000 |
| **Travel** | Site visits, etc. | $1,000 |
| **Contingency** | Buffer for unexpected costs (recommended 10%). | $1,800 |

### Step 3: Save

Click **Create** to finalize the budget plan.

## Tracking Actuals vs Budget

Once the project is active and people are logging time or expenses, the budget updates automatically.

To view the status:

1.  Open the **Project**.
2.  Navigate to the **Budget** tab.
3.  Review the table:

| Column | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Budgeted** | What you planned to spend. |
| **Actual** | What has been spent so far (Approved Timesheets + Vendor Bills). |
| **Variance** | The difference. Positive is good (Under Budget), Negative is bad (Over Budget). |
| **Utilization %** | Percentage of budget consumed. |

## Handling Budget Overruns

If you see a category turning red (Over Budget):

1.  **Investigate**: Click the line to see the specific timesheets or bills driving the cost.
2.  **Reallocate**: If "Labor" is over but "Travel" is under, you might accept the variance if the total is safe.
3.  **Revise**: If the scope changed, create a new Budget version (e.g., "Revised Budget v2") to reflect the new reality.
