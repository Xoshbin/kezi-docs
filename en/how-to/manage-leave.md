### Managing Approvals (For Managers)

Managers receive notifications when their team members request leave.

1. Navigate to **HR → Leave Requests**.
2. Filter by status: **Pending**.
3. Open the request and review:
   - Does the employee have enough balance?
   - Do the dates conflict with other team members?
4. **Take Action**:
   - Click **Approve** to authorize the leave.
   - Click **Reject** if the leave cannot be granted (you must provide a reason).

### Cancelling Leave

- **Pending Requests**: You can delete or edit a pending request directly.
- **Approved Requests**: To change an approved leave, you must first change the status to `Cancelled`. This will automatically restore the days to your balance.

### Checking Your Balance

2. Look for the **Leave Balances** section.
3. You will see a breakdown of:
   - **Entitled**: Total for the year.

   - **Remaining**: Days still available to you.
