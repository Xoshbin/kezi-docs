# Generating Financial Reports

Kezi provides a powerful suite of financial reports to help you track your business performance and maintain accounting accuracy. This guide explains how to access, filter, and export these reports.

## Accessing Reports

All financial reports are located in the **Accounting** module:

1.  Navigate to **Accounting** in the main sidebar.
2.  Select **Reports** from the navigation menu.
3.  Choose the specific report you wish to view (e.g., Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss).

## Common Filter Options

Most reports share a set of universal filters to help you drill down into your data.

### 1. Date Range
For period-based reports (like Profit and Loss or General Ledger):
- **Start Date**: The beginning of the period you want to analyze.
- **End Date**: The end of the period.

### 2. As of Date
For point-in-time reports (like Balance Sheet or Trial Balance):
- This filter sets the exact moment for the snapshot. Any transaction after this date will be excluded.

### 3. Comparison
You can compare your current performance against previous periods:
- **Compare with Previous Period**: Compares the selected range with the immediately preceding period of the same length.
- **Compare with Previous Year**: Compares the selected range with the same dates from the previous year.

### 4. Account Filtering
In reports like the **General Ledger**, you can select specific accounts or account groups to view instead of the entire chart of accounts.

## Generating the Report

After setting your desired filters:
1.  Click the **Generate Report** button (represented by the <heroicon-o-play class="w-4 h-4 inline"/> icon).
2.  The system will process your data and display the report table below.

> [!TIP]
> If you change filters after generating, remember to click **Generate Report** again to refresh the data.

## Exporting and Sharing

Once a report is generated, you can export it for external use or auditing:

*   **PDF**: Best for printing, archiving, or sharing with stakeholders.
*   **Excel/CSV**: Best for further data analysis, custom calculations, or importing into other tools.

To export, look for the **Export** button at the top right of the generated report and select your preferred format.
