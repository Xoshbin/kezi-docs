# Employment Contract Management

Employment contracts are the legal foundation of the relationship between your company and its employees. They define the terms of employment, compensation, and working conditions.

## Key Features

- **Automated Numbering**: Contracts are automatically assigned unique tracking numbers.
- **Compensation Tracking**: Manage base salary, hourly rates, and various allowances (housing, transport, meal).
- **Working Conditions**: Define weekly hours, working days, and leave entitlements (annual, sick, maternity/paternity).
- **Probation Management**: Track probation periods and end dates.
- **Flexible Contract Types**: Support for Permanent, Fixed-Term, Temporary, Consultancy, and Internship contracts.

## Creating a Contract

1. Navigate to **Human Resources > Employment Contracts**.
2. Click **New Employment Contract**.
3. Select the **Employee**.
4. Choose the **Contract Type**.
    - For non-permanent contracts, an **End Date** is required.
5. Set the **Start Date**.
6. In **Compensation Details**:
    - Select the **Currency**.
    - Enter the **Base Salary** and **Pay Frequency**.
    - Add any recurring **Allowances**.

8. Click **Create** to save the contract.

## Contract Status

Contracts can be marked as **Active** or **Inactive**. An active contract is required for payroll processing and attendance tracking.

The **Probation Period (Months)** field allows you to track the initial trial phase. Setting this along with the **Probation End Date** helps HR manage performance reviews before confirming permanent employment.
