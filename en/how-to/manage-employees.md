# How-to: Manage Employees

This guide covers the day-to-day tasks of managing employee records, including creating new records, updating information, and handling departures.

### Accessing Employees

To manage your team, navigate to:
**HR → Employees**

---

### Creating a New Employee

Follow these steps to add a new team member to the system:

1. Click the **New Employee** button.
2. **Personal Tab**: Enter their legal name, email, and personal contact details.
3. **Job Tab**: 
   - Assign their **Department** and **Position**.
   - Select their **Manager** (critical for leave approvals).
   - Set the **Join Date**.
4. **Financial Tab**: Enter their bank account details to ensure they can be paid.
5. **Attachments**: Upload a copy of their ID and any initial documents.
6. Click **Save**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Creating an employee record does not automatically generate a salary. You must create an [Employment Contract](employment-contracts.md) linked to this employee to enable Payroll.

### Updating Employee Information

As your team grows, you'll need to update their records.

#### Handling a Promotion or Transfer
1. Open the employee's record.
2. In the **Job** tab, update the **Department**, **Position**, or **Manager**.
3. If their salary changes, go to their **Contracts** and create a new contract or update the current one.

#### Updating Bank Details
1. Open the employee's record.
2. Update the **Bank Account** field.
3. Ensure this change is made **before** the monthly payroll is processed.

### Terminating an Employee

When an employee leaves the company, follow these steps:

1. Open their employee record.
2. Set the **Termination Date**.
3. Change the **Status** to `Terminated`.
4. Add any relevant notes regarding their departure.
5. Save the record.

### Linking to a User Account

If an employee needs to use the ERP (e.g., to record their own attendance or apply for leave):

1. Open the employee record.
2. Search for their **User** account in the "User" or "System Account" field.
3. If they don't have a user account yet, an administrator must create one first.
