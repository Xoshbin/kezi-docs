# Cash Flow Statement: Following Your Money

This guide explains how to use the **Cash Flow Statement** to track the actual movement of money in and out of your business. If the Profit & Loss tells you if you are *profitable*, the Cash Flow Statement tells you if you are *solvent* (able to pay your bills).

## What is a Cash Flow Statement?

The Cash Flow Statement shows the cash generated and used during a specific period. It answers the critical question: *"Why do I have (or not have) cash in the bank, even though I made a profit?"*

It is divided into three main activities:

1.  **Operating Activities**: Cash from day-to-day business (e.g., receipts from customers, payments to suppliers).
2.  **Investing Activities**: Cash from buying or selling long-term assets (e.g., buying a new machine, selling a vehicle).
3.  **Financing Activities**: Cash from funding sources (e.g., taking a bank loan, owner investments, paying dividends).

**Why does this matter?**
1.  **Survival**: You can be profitable on paper but go bankrupt if you run out of cash to pay rent or salaries.
2.  **Planning**: Helps you predict future cash needs.
3.  **Insight**: Shows if your business operations are generating enough cash to grow.

## Understanding the Sections

### 1. Operating Activities
This section starts with your **Net Profit** (from the P&L) and adjusts it for non-cash items and changes in working capital.
*   **Net Income**: The starting point.
*   **Depreciation**: Any non-cash depreciation expense is added back (since you didn't actually pay cash for it this month).
*   **Changes in Working Capital**:
    *   *Accounts Receivable*: If this increases, cash decreases (customers owe you more).
    *   *Accounts Payable*: If this increases, cash increases (you held onto cash by delaying payment).
    *   *Inventory*: If you buy more stock, cash decreases.

### 2. Investing Activities
Shows cash spent or received from long-term investments.
*   **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: Shows as a negative number (cash outflow).
*   **Sale of Fixed Assets**: Shows as a positive number (cash inflow).

### 3. Financing Activities
Shows cash flows related to funding the business.
*   **Loans Received**: Cash inflow.
*   **Loan Repayments**: Cash outflow (principal only).
*   **Capital Contributions**: Owners putting money in.
*   **Dividends/Drawings**: Owners taking money out.

### 4. Net Change in Cash
The total increase or decrease in cash for the period.
*   **Beginning Cash Balance**: Cash at the start date.
*   **Ending Cash Balance**: Cash at the end date.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Cash vs. Profit**
> "Profit is an opinion, Cash is a fact."
> You can manipulate profit with accounting rules (like depreciation or accruals), but your bank balance is a hard number.

## Interpreting the Numbers

### Positive Operating Cash Flow
This is generally good! It means your core business is generating cash.

### Negative Operating Cash Flow
This can be a warning sign. It might mean you are:
*   Not collecting payments from customers fast enough.
*   Buying too much inventory.
*   Operating at a loss.

### Disconnect Between Profit and Cash
**Scenario**: You show a $10,000 profit but your bank account is empty.
**Why?**
*   Maybe you spent $15,000 buying a new machine (Investing Activity).
*   Maybe customers bought $20,000 of goods on credit but haven't paid yet (Accounts Receivable increase).
*   Maybe you paid off a large loan (Financing Activity).

## Best Practices

### 📅 Timing
*   **Review Monthly**: Check this report alongside your P&L and Balance Sheet.
*   **Forecast**: Use historical cash flow trends to predict future cash needs (e.g., "We always run low on cash in January").

### 🔍 Drilling Down
*   **Investigate Spikes**: If you see a large change in Accounts Receivable, check your **Aged Receivables** report to see who hasn't paid.
