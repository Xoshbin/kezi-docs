# How-to: Track Attendance

Attendance tracking ensures you have a record of who is working and helps automate "Unpaid Leave" calculations in payroll.

### Recording Daily Attendance

To record attendance for yourself or your team:

1. Navigate to: **HR → Attendances**.
2. Click **New Attendance**.
3. Select the **Employee**.
4. Set the **Date**.
5. **Clock In/Out**: Enter the precise time the shift started and ended.
6. **Total Hours**: The system can calculate the total duration between clock-in and clock-out.
7. Click **Save**.

### Understanding Attendance Status

While viewing the attendance list, you can see if entries are regular or marked as issues (e.g., late arrivals). 

- **Present**: Normal working day.
- **Absent**: A day where the employee did not show up and has no approved leave.
- **On Leave**: Linked directly to an approved [Leave Request](manage-leave.md).

### Importing Attendance

For companies using external biometric machines:
1. Format your data according to the Kezi import template.
2. Use the **Import** feature on the Attendance list page to upload a CSV/Excel file of all daily clock-ins.
