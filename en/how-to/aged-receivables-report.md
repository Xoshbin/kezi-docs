# Aged Receivables Report: Track Who Owes You Money

This guide explains how the Aged Receivables Report works in plain language. Whether you're an accountant or a business owner, this report is your key to managing cash flow and ensuring you get paid on time.

---

## What is the Aged Receivables Report?

Think of the Aged Receivables Report as a "To-Do List" for collecting payments. It shows you exactly which customers owe you money and, more importantly, **how long** they have owed it.

**Why does this matter?**
1.  **Cash Flow**: Helps you predict when money will come in.
2.  **Credit Control**: Identifies customers who are late so you can follow up.
3.  **Bad Debt Prevention**: Catching overdue payments early prevents them from becoming uncollectible.

## Understanding the Report

Allowed to see the report, you need to understand the concept of **Aging Buckets**. These separate debts by how old they are based on the **Due Date** of the invoice.

| Bucket | What it Means | Action Needed |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Current** | Invoices not yet due. | None yet (wait for payment). |
| **1-30 Days** | 1 to 30 days past the due date. | Send a friendly reminder. |
| **31-60 Days** | 31 to 60 days past due. | Call the customer; check for issues. |
| **61-90 Days** | 61 to 90 days past due. | Serious follow-up; possibly pause services. |
| **90+ Days** | More than 90 days overdue. | Risk of bad debt; consider collection agency or legal action. |

## Using the Report Filters

To get the most out of the report, use the available filters:

### As Of Date
This determines the "snapshot" date for the report.
- **Scenario**: Today is Feb 15, but you want to see what your receivables looked like on Dec 31 for year-end closing. Set the "As Of Date" to **Dec 31**.

---

## Making It Make Sense: A Real Example

**The Situation**:
You run a wholesale business. You check the Aged Receivables Report on **April 1st**.

**What you see:**
- **Customer A**: owes $500 in the **Current** bucket.
  - *Translation*: They bought something recently, and the bill isn't due yet. All good!
- **Customer B**: owes $1,000 in the **31-60 Days** bucket.
  - *Translation*: Their bill was due in February. They are late! You need to call them.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Why isn't an invoice showing up?
**A:** Check the following:
1.  Is the invoice **Posted**? Draft invoices don't appear in financial reports.
2.  Is the **As Of Date** correct? If the invoice date is after the "As Of Date", it won't show.
3.  Has it been **Paid**? If you recorded a payment, the balance will be zero (or reduced).

### Q: Why does a customer have a negative balance?
**A:** This usually means they have **overpaid** or have a **Credit Note** that hasn't been applied to an invoice yet. It means you owe *them* money (or services).

## Best Practices

- **Review Weekly**: Make this report part of your Monday morning routine.
- **Act Fast**: The longer a debt sits, the harder it is to collect.
- **Reconcile**: Ensure the "Grand Total" matches the "Accounts Receivable" balance on your [Balance Sheet](balance-sheet-report.md).
