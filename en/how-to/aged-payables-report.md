# Aged Payables Report: Track Who You Owe Money To

This guide explains how the Aged Payables Report works in plain language. Whether you're a business owner or a finance manager, this report is your key to managing your outgoing cash flow and maintaining good relationships with your suppliers.

---

## What is the Aged Payables Report?

Think of the Aged Payables Report as a **"To-Do List" for paying bills**. It shows you exactly which suppliers (vendors) you owe money to and, more importantly, **how long** it has been since the bill was due.

**Why does this matter?**
1.  **Cash Flow Management**: Helps you plan when money needs to leave your bank account.
2.  **Avoid Late Fees**: Identifies bills that are coming due or are overdue so you can pay them first.
3.  **Vendor Relationships**: Paying on time keeps your suppliers happy, which can lead to better terms in the future.

## Understanding the Report

To use the report, you need to understand the concept of **Aging Buckets**. These separate your debts by how old they are based on the **Due Date** of the vendor bill.

| Bucket | What it Means | Action Needed |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Current** | Bills not yet due. | Plan for payment soon. |
| **1-30 Days** | 1 to 30 days past the due date. | Pay these now to avoid becoming significantly overdue. |
| **31-60 Days** | 31 to 60 days past due. | Contact the vendor if there's a delay; prioritize this payment. |
| **61-90 Days** | 61 to 90 days past due. | High priority. Late fees or service suspension may occur. |
| **90+ Days** | More than 90 days overdue. | Critical. You risk damaging your credit or vendor relationship. |

## Using the Report Filters

To get the most out of the report, use the available filters:

### As Of Date
This determines the "snapshot" date for the report.
- **Scenario**: Today is April 10, but you want to see exactly what you owed on **March 31** for your month-end accounts. Set the "As Of Date" to **March 31**.

## Making It Make Sense: A Real Example

**The Situation**:
You run a retail store. You check the Aged Payables Report on **November 1st**.

**What you see:**
- **Supplier A (Office Supplies)**: you owe $200 in the **Current** bucket.
  - *Translation*: You bought paper recently, and the bill isn't due yet. No rush.
- **Supplier B (Electronics Wholesaler)**: you owe $5,000 in the **31-60 Days** bucket.
  - *Translation*: This bill was due in September. It is overdue! You should pay this immediately to avoid issues with your next order.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Why isn't a vendor bill showing up?
**A:** Check the following:
1.  Is the bill **Posted**? Draft bills do not appear in financial reports.
2.  Is the **As Of Date** correct? If the bill date is after the "As Of Date", it won't show.
3.  Has it been **Paid**? If you recorded a payment, the balance will be zero (or reduced).

### Q: Why does a vendor have a negative balance?
**A:** This usually means you have **overpaid** them or have a **Debit Note** (vendor credit) that hasn't been used yet. It means the vendor owes *you* money or credit towards a future purchase.

## Best Practices

- **Review Weekly**: Check this report before doing your weekly payment run.
- **Prioritize**: Always pay overdue bills first to avoid penalties or disrupted service.
- **Reconcile**: Ensure the "Grand Total" matches the "Accounts Payable" balance on your [Balance Sheet](balance-sheet-report.md).
