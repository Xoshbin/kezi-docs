# How to Manage Projects

This guide covers the practical steps for creating, updating, and closing projects in Kezi ERP.

---

## Creating a Project

To start a new project:

1.  Navigate to **Project Management > Projects**.
2.  Click **Create**.
3.  Fill in the **Project Details**:
    *   **Project Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "Website Redesign").
    *   **Customer**: The client you are doing work for.
    *   **Manager**: The person responsible for the project.
    *   **Billing Type**: Select **Fixed**, **Time & Materials**, or **Non-billable**.
    *   **Dates**: Start and estimated end date.
4.  Click **Create**.

The project starts in **Draft** status.

## Activating the Project

When planning is complete and work is ready to begin:

1.  Open the **Draft** project.
2.  Click the **Activate** action (or change status to **In Progress**).
3.  The project is now live. Team members can strictly log time against it.

---

## Adding Tasks

Break down the work into tasks:

1.  Open the project.
2.  Go to the **Tasks** tab.
3.  Click **Create Task**.
4.  Enter the **Task Name** (e.g., "Design Mockups"), **Assignee**, and **Estimated Hours**.
5.  Save.

## Monitoring Progress

To check how your project is doing:

1.  **Dashboard**: View the **Project Overview** widget for a high-level summary.
2.  **Project View**: Open the project to see:
    *   **Budget Tab**: Variance between planned and actual costs.
    *   **Timesheets Tab**: All hours logged by the team.
    *   **Invoices Tab**: billed amounts.

---

## Closing a Project

When all work is done and the final invoice sent:

1.  Open the project.
2.  Change the status to **Completed**.
3.  This prevents any further time logging or cost accumulation.

> **Note**: You can re-open a completed project if new work arises, but it is better to create a new project or a "Phase 2" project for clarity.
