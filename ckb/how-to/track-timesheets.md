# How to Track Timesheets

This guide explains how employees record work hours and how managers approve them.

## For Employees: Logging Time

### Step 1: Create a Timesheet

1. Go to **Project Management → Timesheets**.
2. Click **Create**.
3. The system selects **You** as the employee.
4. Select the **Week Period** (e.g., Jan 1 - Jan 7).

### Step 2: Add Daily Lines

Click **Add Line** for each block of work:

*   **Date**: When you did the work.
*   **Project**: The project you worked on.
*   **Task**: (Optional) specific task.
*   **Hours**: e.g., 4.5.
*   **Description**: Briefly describe what you did.
*   **Billable**: Check if this time should be billed to the client.

### Step 3: Submit

1.  Check your **Total Hours** at the bottom.
2.  Click **Submit**.
3.  The status changes to `Submitted`. You can no longer edit it unless rejected.

## For Managers: Approving Time

### Step 1: Review Submissions

1.  Go to **Project Management → Timesheets**.
2.  Filter for **Status: Submitted**.
3.  Open a timesheet.

### Step 2: Validate Entries

Check for:
*   **Accuracy**: Do the hours make sense?
*   **Billable Status**: Are internal meetings marked non-billable?
*   **Descriptions**: Are they clear enough for the client invoice?

### Step 3: Approve or Reject

*   **Approve**: Locks the timesheet. Costs are booked to the project.
*   **Reject**: You must provide a reason. The timesheet returns to `Draft` for the employee to fix.

## Correcting Errors

If a mistake is found **after** approval:

1.  You cannot edit the approved timesheet (it is a legal/financial record).
2.  You must create a **Adjustment Timesheet** (negative hours) or a new entry to correct the balance.
3.  Contact your administrator for help with complex adjustments.
