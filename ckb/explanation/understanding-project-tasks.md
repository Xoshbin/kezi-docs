# Understanding Project Tasks

This guide explains how to use **Project Tasks** to organize work, track progress, and ensure your team knows exactly what needs to be done. Whether you are a project manager or a team member, this guide will help you manage your daily work effectively.

## What are Project Tasks?

Think of a **Project Task** as a single unit of work that needs to be completed. It’s the answer to the question: *"What do I need to do today?"*

A project is made up of many tasks. For example, if the **Project** is "Renovate the Office", the **Tasks** might be:
1.  Paint the walls
2.  Install new desks
3.  Set up the internet

**Why use Tasks?**
1.  **Clarity**: Everyone knows exactly what they are responsible for.
2.  **Tracking**: You can see what is "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".
3.  **Time Management**: You can track how much time is spent on each specific job.

> **💡 Analogy**: If a **Project** is the destination, **Tasks** are the steps you take to get there.

## The Task Lifecycle

Every task goes through a lifecycle from creation to completion. In Kezi ERP, this corresponds to the **Kanban Stages**.

### 1. To Do (New) 📝
The task has been created but work hasn't started yet. It is waiting in the backlog.
*   **Action**: Assign it to a team member and set a deadline.

### 2. In Progress (Doing) 🏗️
Work has begun. The assignee is actively working on this task.
*   **Action**: Log time in the timesheet to track effort.

### 3. Review / Testing 🔍
The work is done but needs to be checked (e.g., code review, quality check).
*   **Action**: Manager or peer reviews the work.

### 4. Done (Completed) ✅
The task is fully complete and approved.
*   **Action**: Move to the "Done" stage. High five! ✋

## How to Manage Tasks

### Creating a New Task

Navigate to: **Project Management → Project Tasks → Create Task**

Fill in the key details:
*   **Title**: A clear, action-oriented name (e.g., "Draft Monthly Report").
*   **Project**: Which project does this belong to?
*   **Assignee**: Who is doing the work?
*   **Deadline**: When must it be finished?
*   **Description**: Detailed instructions, checklists, or links.

### Assigning & Scheduling

Don't let tasks float in the void!
1.  **Assign a Person**: A task without an owner rarely gets done.
2.  **Set a Due Date**: Give it a timeline.
3.  **Add Tags**: Use tags (e.g., "Urgent", "Bug", "Feature") to categorize.

### Tracking Time ⏱️

If your project is billed by the hour, tracking time is critical.
1.  Open the Task.
2.  Go to the **Timesheets** tab.
3.  Add a line: **Date**, **Description** (what you did), and **Time Spent** (e.g., 2 hours).

> **Note**: This data feeds into the Project Profitability report!

## Working with Subtasks

Sometimes a task is too big (e.g., "Build Website"). You can break it down into **Subtasks**:
*   *Design Homepage*
*   *Write Content*
*   *Code Backend*

Use the **Subtasks** checklist within the main task to track these smaller steps without cluttering your main project board.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Why can't I see a task assigned to me?
**A:** Check your filters. By default, you might only see "Open" tasks. Clear the filters to see "All" or check if you are looking at the correct Project.

### Q: How do I move a task to a different stage?
**A:** You can simply **drag and drop** the task card from one column to another on the Kanban board (Board View), or change the **Stage** dropdown inside the task form.

### Q: I finished the task, but the project isn't 100% complete?
**A:** A project is only complete when *all* its tasks are done. Check if there are any orphaned tasks left in the "To Do" column.

## Best Practices

*   **Be Specific**: "Fix bugs" is bad. "Fix login error on mobile" is good.
*   **Update Daily**: Move tasks to "Done" as soon as you finish. Don't wait until Friday.
*   **Use Comments**: Discuss the work *on the task* itself, not in email. This keeps the history in one place.
*   **Keep it Small**: If a task takes more than 3 days, break it into smaller tasks.
